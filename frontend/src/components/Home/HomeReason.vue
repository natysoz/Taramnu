                    Cause We Care Foundation was founded in 2007 for the purpose of empowering single mothers and
                    children living in poverty in our community.
                    With support from donors and volunteers like you, our efforts are stronger and more impactful than
                    any one of us can achieve alone.
                    Together we can break the cycle of poverty for single mothers and their children, and in doing so,
                    we can uplift our communities.
